# Capstone-PowerBI-Sales-Dashboard

For my capstone project, I developed a sophisticated Power BI dashboard that provides a detailed analysis of sales data across multiple dimensions. The dashboard presents total sales, discounts, and other key metrics with an interactive collapsible time slicer, allowing users to filter data by year, quarter, month, and day. This makes it easier to drill down into specific time periods for more granular insights.

The visualizations cover various categories such as Men's Fashion, Beauty & Grooming, and Kids & Baby, offering a comprehensive view of sales distribution by category, payment method, and order status. The dashboard highlights the status of orders, breaking them down into categories like complete, canceled, and refunded, along with a detailed analysis of sales trends over time.

The design and functionality of this dashboard underscore my proficiency in using Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. The user-friendly interface and dynamic visualizations make it a powerful tool for supporting data-driven decision-making. Explore the dashboard to see how it can help in analyzing sales data effectively.
